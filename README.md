Introduction to 1D and 2D arrays in java.

Regular mode:
In this mode, player 1 will place 5 ships: a PT Boat (2 units long), a submarine (3 units long),
a destroyer (3 units long), a battleship (4 units long), and a carrier (5 units long).
Then, player 2 will have a given number of guesses. An 'O' will represent an unknown location,
a '.' will represent a miss, a '!' will represent a hit and a 'x' will represent a sunk ship."
If player 2 manages to sink all the ships in the given number of guesses, player 2 will win. Otherwise, player 1 will win.

Speed Mode:
In this mode, the computer will place 3 ships: a submarine (3 units long), a battleship (4 units long), and a carrier (5 units long).
Then, you will have 20 guesses. An 'O' will represent an unknown location, 
a '.' will represent a miss, a '!' will represent a hit and a 'x' will represent a sunk ship."
If you manage to sink all the ships in the given number of guesses, you will win. Otherwise, the computer will win.
